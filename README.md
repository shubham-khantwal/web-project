## HOW I CREATED SO EASILY

STEPS

1- CREATE A REPOSITORY 
2- GO TO SETTINGS
3- CHECK YOU HAVE SELECTED MASTER AS YOUR CURRENT ACTIVE REPOSITORY 
4. BELOW IT YOU WILL FIND THE THEMES YOU WANT TO SET FOR YOUR WEBSITE 
5. ABOVE THIS YOU  WILL FIND THE LINK TO YOUR WEBSITE

** SOME FACT **
__ These are not website but github pages that we create __

** ANOTHER WAY **

YOU CAN DIRECTLY UPLOAD YOUR WEBSITE CODE IN THE REPOSITORY

** THIRD WAY **

YOU CAN CREATE NEW FILE AND WRITE HTML CODE 

NOTE : IT TAKES TIME TO UPDATE THE CHANGES ON REFRESHING THE LINK OF THE WEBSITE
